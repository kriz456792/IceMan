# IceMan

This is the final project for an advanced C++ class at El Camino College. I've decided to redo this project on my own to improve on the orginal code I sumbmitted.
These are the main files I'll be working on:
Actor.h
Actor.cpp
StudentWorld.h
StudentWorld.cpp

Here is an example image of the finished product.
Again, I've already worked on this project. This is simply a redo of my previous work to improve my coding skills.

In this game, the protagonist is the IceMan who is looking for oil barrels burried in the ice sheet. To find what he is looking for he must dig his way through the ice while
voiding the protesters who shout at him when they come in close range. If they shout at him for too long, he will weaken and die, through the game he only has 3 lives. Once he
has lost all of his lives, the game ends and he must start again from level 0. If he is able to survive the level by collecting the oil barrels, diggin through ice, using his 
water gun to fight off the protesters, collecting gold to bribe the protesters, and more, he can go on to the next leve where the difficulties increase.
